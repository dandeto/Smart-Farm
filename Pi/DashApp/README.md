# DASH App => Smart Farm Viewer

#### Quick-Links
* **[Architecture Notes]()**

## Purpose
The purpos of this app is to visualize smart farm data.

## Usage
It will be used by a farm owner or manager to look at their field sensors data and judge how the soil is doing. This will allow them to make better decisions about how to keep the field and areas of it healthy.

## Installing Requirements

### Instructions on how to get the Prerequisits

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder with DashApp

```bash
python3 -m venv dash-app-env
source dash-app-env/bin/activate
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
pip install --ignore-installed -r requirements.txt
pip-review --auto
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

The last command above will list all of the installed packages, and output them to the requirements.txt file. Instead of installing the packages you need one by one, you should use your requirements.txt file to install the packages. This has two benefits:
    1. You don’t have to manually type pip install 10 times to get all of your packages installed
    1. You don’t have to worry about getting the right version installed


### Prerequisits to run or develop docker

From the root folder run:
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f
docker-compose down
```

### Architecture Notes:

#### MVC Folders:
Often separate pages will have their functionality separated out in a Model-View-Controller (MVC) fashion. In this app there is a folder for the page, then there is a data.py, interaction.py, and view.py file inside it.

The advantage of this is three-fold:
1. There is a very clear distiction of file responisbility, thus you know where to edit code.
2. You can test the data.py file on it's own without all the dash app interaction and view code failing on you.
3. Because of the separation of concerns, it is easier to have multiple people work on separate parts of the app without creating merge conflicts.

### Helpful Code Snippets

#### General Tips:
- an empty figure can be returned as an empty dictionary {}, this is better than returning values that are non-figures like -1, if a figure is expected. 

#### Determining Which Callback Fired - Basic

There is a multi input callback, so how do you know which input was triggered?
Use the following code in the callback function:
```python
ctx = callback_context
updated = ctx.triggered[0]['prop_id'].split('.')[0]
print(f"Updated Input: {updated}")
```

#### Determining Which Callback Fired - Pattern Matching

There is a multi input callback for pattern matching, so how do you know which input was triggered?
Use the following code in the callback function:
```python
ctxDict = json.loads(callback_context.triggered[0]['prop_id'].split('.')[0])
updated = ctxDict.get('type')
print(f"Updated Input: {updated}")
```
